If you want to detect the lie in a live stream, run "lie_detect_stream.py" and use the camera of the device.

If you want to detect the lie in an already captured video, run "lie_detect_video.py" and copy the path of the video in line 67 inside.
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(## enter the path here ##)

Once the video is complete, the result will be shown in the terminal.

Now, input 'y' in the terminal to show more details about the lie detected
